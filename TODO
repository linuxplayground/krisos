# Todo

A list of things for a rainy day

* VIA routines for the LCD and SN76489 are destructive of pins on the VIA that could be used for other things
* The LCD routines are not great
* There is only one routine in the standard library, and no way to update memory locations for users of it
* A bunch of CA65 commands are available, can use them to make code clearer
* Commands should accept parameters, like dump could dump any arbitrary page
* Loading user programs shouldn't rely on $1000 -- Xmodem assumes this, and the binaries need to be formated to include that locations
* Rewrite a bunch of the borrowed code
* Could conditionally assemble for instructions for non-WDC 6502 chips, but, meh?
* Go digging for hardcoded constants and make those go away
* Make configuration for other systems even easier
* Create macros to be a little more DRY
* ~Write an example in C using cc65~
* Add more constants for VT100, xterm, etc
* Make user input more robust (e.g. arrow keys shouldn't do a thing)
* Add additional commands: `peek`, `poke`, VIA pin control?
* Get EhBasic running as an example
* Fix whatever bug I introduced into Microchess
* Display more information on the LCD -- Running program? Uptime?
* ~Set a timer on one of the VIAs to calculate ticks~
* Get the clock speed estimation code working
* Handle IRQs from different sources
* Create a simple text editor example
* Create a RAM test procedure
* Create system tests?
* How do you even unit test?
